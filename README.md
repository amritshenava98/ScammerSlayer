## ScammerSlayer

Have you ever received texts from unknown numbers or emails where there is a link that asks for your credit numbers? Some have a story that your package is stuck and some.... well, at the end of the day, it is bogus and all they want is your credit card details. Unfortunately, many people fall for it. This is why, I have written a python script that populates the databases of these scammers with fake data. I have messed around with a bunch of scammers and hope to build a tool/app where users input a link and AI will detect the the request URL, the fields and will do it's magic.

#### Note : This is v1 and still under development, there is a lot more work to be done and will be structuring the entire code.
