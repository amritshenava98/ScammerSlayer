## ScammerSlayer

Have you ever received texts from unknown numbers or emails where there is a link that asks for your credit numbers? Some have a story that your package is stuck and some.... well, at the end of the day, it is bogus and all they want is your credit card details. Unfortunately, many people fall for it and it is very sad. This is why, I have written a python to script that populates the databases of these scammers with fake data.

#### Note : This is v1 and still under development, there is a lot more work and will be structuring the entire code.
